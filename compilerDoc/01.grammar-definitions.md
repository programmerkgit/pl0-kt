# Context Free Grammar
G {N, T, P, S}  
- G is context Free Grammar
- N is non terminal symbols
- T is terminal symbols
- S is start symbols N.contains(S)

## G{P, S}
=> S is start symbol.
=> P is production rule.
V is collection of symbols appear in P.  

## V: Vocabulary  
1. V is N and T  
2. T is Token.
123 is not terminal symbol. Terminal symbols is Integer(123).  
So, 123 is not vocabulary.  

# Directly produce
## PreCondition
- G = {P, S}
- x, y includes V*
- U -> u (u includes V*) 
## Condition
if v, w includes V* is
- v = xUy
- w = xuy
## then
v directly produce w. this writes v => w.
and w is directly reduced to v.   U -> u then, U => u. 

# produce

## Condition
U directory produce u directory produce u0 => u1 => u2, ... u(n) 
## then
U produces u2. This writes U =>* u2. if n > 0, U =>+ u2.  
u2 reduced to U.  

# Language
L(G) { x | U =>* x and x includes T* }

# Context Free Grammar
U => u
# Context-Sensitive Grammar
xUy => xuy
xUz => xu2z
